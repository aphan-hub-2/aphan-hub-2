    Amidst the storm that is COVID-19, 
    my duties as an art student felt… grossly unimportant. 
    
    Grades are just a made-up point system to gauge 
    how well a student could follow instructions. 
        
    GPA has no real bearing on my worth as a person 
    or my ability to create meaningful art. 
    So why would school matter now in the grand scheme of things?
    
    I could not bring myself to care about a number.
    
    I knew deep down that my passion for art didn’t waver 
    but I felt so helpless. 
    
    How much can an artist, 
    let alone one that is still a student, 
    really help the people?
