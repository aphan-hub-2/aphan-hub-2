    The other day I woke up thinking it was Thursday. 
    When I opened my eyes, the room was dimly lit 
    and my eyes felt heavy with grogginess. 
    My phone told me that it was actually Monday afternoon at 5 pm 
    and I had slept through a deadline and a Zoom meeting. 
    I have three other classes to worry about as well 
    but at this moment as I stared at the ceiling in my bed, 
    I felt disconnected from my own feelings.
