Learning my own worth outside of my productivity will be a lifelong process. 
A nonlinear process that will see peaks and valleys throughout my career. 

But as cheesy as it sounds, Iâ€™m not alone; 
I am deeply loved and supported in my found family 
as they remind me that I am cared for 
regardless of my GPA or my productivity.
